Hi there! 

I'm Daniel (丹尼尔, دانیال).

I want to understand the universe in the broadest possible sense. I enjoy thinking about physics, mathematics, computer science, and biology, but also about economics, language, and history. 

I'm currently working at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and biology, as a Machine Learning Engineer in the BioAI team at InstaDeep (acquired by BioNTech). Before that I worked on reinforcement learning in the AI Research team.

Here are some other facts about me:
- ⚛️ I studied Physics (Oxford University), specialising in theoretical biophysics. 
- 🧬 I studied Biotechnology (Cambridge University), doing my thesis in protein engineering. 
- ☁️ I was a key contributor to an [MLOps template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-pipelines-end-to-end-samples) co-developed with and jointly open sourced by Google Cloud Platform. 
- 🦁 I am a key contributor to [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji), InstaDeep's open source suite of reinforcement learning environments written in JAX. 

My core values are:
- 🌱 First principles thinking
- 🤔 Curiosity
- 🙌 Humility
- 🚀 Interdisciplinarity
