Hi, I’m Daniel!
- 👨‍💻 I am a machine learning engineer at Datatonic, where I help companies develop ML solutions and deploy them into production. 
- ⚛️ I studied Physics as an undergraduate and ended up specialising in biophysics and atmospheric physics.
- 🧬 I did a master's in biotechnology, where I applied computational techniques to guide enzyme engineering.
- 🌱 I have just finished the Deep Learning Specialization offered by the good folks at deeplearning.ai - as a trained physicist, I solve problems from first principles, and this course excels in teaching machine learning theory from first principles!
- 🤓 I am currently working my way through the NLP Specialization also offered by deeplearning.ai - great fun so far!
- 🔬 I am looking to collaborate on projects that leverage AI to advance science, especially the life sciences.
