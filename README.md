Hi there! 

I'm Daniel (丹尼尔, دانیال).

I am currently working at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and biology, as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at CoSyne Therapeutics. Before that, I was working on mRNA-based cancer vaccines at InstaDeep (BioNTech). Prior to that, I worked on reinforcement learning in InstaDeep's AI Research team. 

Here are some other facts about me:
- ⚛️ I studied Physics (Oxford University), specialising in theoretical biophysics. 
- 🧬 I studied Biotechnology (Cambridge University), doing my thesis in protein engineering. 
- ☁️ I was a key contributor to an [MLOps template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-pipelines-end-to-end-samples) co-developed with and jointly open sourced by Google Cloud Platform. 
- 🦁 I am a key contributor to [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji), InstaDeep's open source suite of reinforcement learning environments written in JAX. This was published in ICLR 2024 (arXiv preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09884)).
- 📄 I contributed to a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568057v1.full.pdf) on applying diffusion models to model TCRpMHC binding interactions. This was published in the NeurIPS 2023 MLSB workshop.

My core values are:
- 🌱 First principles thinking
- 🧠 Curiosity
- 🙌 Humility
