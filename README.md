Hi, I’m Daniel!
- 👨‍💻 I am a machine learning engineer at Datatonic, where I help companies develop ML solutions and deploy them into production. 
- ⚛️ I have a background in Physics & Biotechnology
- 🌱 I have just finished the Deep Learning Specialization offered by the good folks at deeplearning.ai - as a trained physicist, I solve problems from first principles, and this course excels in that regard! 
- 🤓 I am currently going through the NLP Specialization also offered by deeplearning.ai
- 🔬 I am looking to collaborate on projects that leverage AI to advance science, especially physics and the life sciences!
